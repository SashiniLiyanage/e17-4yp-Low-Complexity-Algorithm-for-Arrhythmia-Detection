## Project Goal

The detection of the electrocardiogram (ECG) QRS complex and associated abnormalities, such as arrhythmias, has been a well-researched area in the field of biomedical engineering. However, implementing efficient algorithms in low power, low cost solutions remains a challenge. This research aims to develop innovative approaches that enable accurate QRS and arrhythmia detection using low complexity and low memory algorithms, which can be deployed on microcontrollers with severely limited capabilities (< 2kB SRAM, 1-8 MHz clock frequency).

To achieve this goal, the research will initially focus on transforming the ECG data into a sparse, event-driven representation that preserves all essential information while streamlining the computational load. This approach will enable efficient processing of critical events and minimize the need for continuously processing every sample, thereby reducing power consumption and memory requirements.

In addition to data transformation, this research will investigate the application of advanced optimization techniques, such as deep learning and swarm particle optimization (SPO), to determine the most suitable parameters for the detection algorithms. These techniques will be employed to refine and adapt the algorithms for optimal performance under the specific hardware constraints.

Moreover, the research will explore methods to classify ECG waveform events based on signal quality and features present within the signal. By employing a layered architecture, the system will select the best parameters based on the output of a pre-trained classifier, further optimizing the performance of the low-cost algorithm.

Another aspect of the research will delve into the development of adaptive, context-aware algorithms that can dynamically adjust their complexity according to the available resources and signal quality. This approach will ensure that the detection accuracy is maintained while minimizing resource consumption, thus enabling the implementation of these algorithms in a wider range of low-cost devices.

The anticipated outcome of this research is a set of versatile, low complexity algorithms for QRS complex and arrhythmia detection, which can be effectively implemented on low power, low cost microcontroller platforms. These solutions have the potential to significantly impact the field of remote health monitoring, enabling the development of affordable, wearable devices capable of providing real-time, accurate cardiac health assessments to a wider population.
